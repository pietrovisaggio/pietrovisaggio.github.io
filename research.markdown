        <p>
          This paper examines how battery storage ownership structure affects wholesale electricity market outcomes by shaping operational incentives. Using a dynamic dispatch model calibrated to ERCOT data, I show how transmission congestion creates conditions in which batteries operated jointly with a renewable plant are used strategically to increase the value of renewable production. The strength of this incentive depends on supply elasticity and the timing of renewable production. Because of this strategic behavior, co-owned batteries earn higher profits, while standalone batteries deliver larger gains in consumer surplus. Market conditions do not generate enough profits for battery investment to be viable, regardless of ownership. Yet if subsidized, co-owned projects would yield the highest net consumer surplus, because the additional revenues they generate reduce the required subsidy sufficiently to outweigh their smaller gross consumer gains.
