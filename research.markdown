          Electricity grids are rapidly decarbonizing, with wind and solar generation playing a central role. Their intermittency, however, complicates their market integration and challenges grid reliability. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are expected to ease these frictions, yet their impact depends critically on ownership. I develop and simulate a dynamic dispatch model of battery utilization, calibrated to ERCOT real-time market data, to study how ownership structure shapes operational incentives. I show that transmission congestion creates market conditions in which co-owned batteries are used strategically: operators charge more during low-price periods, pushing prices upward and thereby increasing the value of contemporaneous renewable output. The strength of this effect depends on supply elasticity and the timing of renewable production. This strategic use has two contrasting effects: it reduces consumer surplus gains relative to standalone operation, but it almost doubles project profitability. As both ownership types require subsidies to be viable, the higher profitability under co-ownership outweighs the smaller consumer gains, making it the more subsidy-efficient option. These findings highlight the importance of ownership design for subsidy policy and market regulation.
